# Thank you for your interest in contributing

Hey there,

Notebook Navigator is currently under heavy development and I am adding new features and optimizing the current architecture at a rapid pace.

This means that I currently do not have the time to review PRs, since it's not just about checking the code quality and if it fits into the current architecture, it's also about checking if your code fits with the architecture I have planned in 3-6 months. 

**Summary: Pull requests are not being accepted right now.**

## Other ways to help

Thank you for your understanding!
